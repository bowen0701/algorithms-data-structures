"""Leetcode 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III
Medium

URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/

Given an array A of 0s and 1s, we may change up to K values from 0 to 1.

Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s. 

Example 1:

Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: 
[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.

Example 2:
Input: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: 
[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.

Note:
- 1 <= A.length <= 20000
- 0 <= K <= A.length
- A[i] is 0 or 1
