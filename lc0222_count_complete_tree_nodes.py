"""Leetcode 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes
Medium

URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/

Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Note:

Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last,
is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as
possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Example:
Input: 
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \  /
4  5 6
Output: 6
